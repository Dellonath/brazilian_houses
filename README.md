# brazilian_houses_searcher_ML

An analysis was made of a total of 10692 houses located in important cities in Brazil. After the exploratory analysis, a decision tree algorithm (sklearn.RandomForestClassifier) was used to find a model capable of predicting in which city you will find a house that meets your demands.<br>
The accuracy of the model is not very effective, the purpose of this notebook file was only to apply the machine learning algorithm. But the data is reliable, and the exploratory analysis can be consulted by anyone who wants to move to Brazil.
